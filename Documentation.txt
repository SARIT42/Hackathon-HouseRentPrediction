APPROACH:

1) We loaded the dataset and checked for null and duplicate values.
2) They were plenty of columns with categorical data.We decided to apply 
   One Hot Encoding to those columns .
3) For the "amenities"  column we decided to split all the instances in the 
   column and create  respective columns for them.
4) Now our dataset is ready for modeling.
5) We used mainly three kinds of regressor i.e XGBoost, CatBoost and LBGMRegressor.
   We also tried blending various model outputs and eventually finalised a stacked model
   of all the above three models using StackingRegressor.
6) The more significant model was CatBoostRegressor where we specifically provided 
   input for the specific columns to be considered categorical columns.
7) We then dumped the model using pickle.
8)
